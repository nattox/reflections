What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, a new git file begins. It will now be able to

because it will make looking through versions of my files possible.
It will also allow me to collaborate much better.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A staging area is for the assembly and grouping of files before they are

my files logically over time and by their relationship to each other. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
